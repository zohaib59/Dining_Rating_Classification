# Dining_Rating_Classification
#  Zomato Dining Rating Classification
Excited to share my latest classification project where I built a multi-model pipeline to predict restaurant Dining Ratings from Zomato data.

This project predicts the **Dining Rating** of restaurants listed on Zomato using multiple classification algorithms. 
It includes data cleaning, encoding, outlier detection, model comparison, and detailed evaluation using scikit-learn metrics.
With over 11 algorithms—including XGBoost, CatBoost, LightGBM, and Neural Networks—I tackled feature engineering, label encoding, scaling, and cross-validation. 
Each model was benchmarked using accuracy, precision, recall, and F1 score.

Predicting Dining Ratings with Zomato Data 


##  Project Highlights
- Cleaned and deduplicated Zomato dataset
- Label encoding for categorical variables
- Outlier detection via visual boxplots
- Scaled features with `StandardScaler`
- Trained 11+ classification models including:
  - Logistic Regression
  - XGBoost, CatBoost, LightGBM
  - Random Forest, Extra Trees
  - MLP (Neural Network), Gradient Boosting
- Evaluated using:
  - Accuracy, Precision, Recall, F1 Score
  - Classification Report & Confusion Matrix
- Organized results in a clear dictionary for comparison
